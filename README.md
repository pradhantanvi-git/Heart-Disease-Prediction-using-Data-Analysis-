# Heart Disease Prediction System using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project is a **Heart Disease Prediction System** developed using **Machine Learning algorithms** to assess the likelihood of heart disease in patients. It is implemented as a **web-based application** where users input their medical parameters, and the system predicts their risk level. The application integrates multiple **ML models**, including:
- **Decision Tree**
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Na誰ve Bayes**
- **Support Vector Classifier (SVC)**

The goal is to assist healthcare professionals and individuals in identifying potential heart disease risks based on key medical attributes.

## Features
- **User Authentication:** Secure user registration and login system.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Implements Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Na誰ve Bayes, and SVC.
- **Database Integration:** Stores user information and prediction results using SQLite.
- **Interactive Web Interface:** Developed using Flask with HTML/CSS frontend.
- **Medical Data Analysis:** Analyzes patient data, including Age, Cholesterol, Blood Pressure, etc.
- **Prediction Results:** Displays risk probability and allows users to take further action.
- **Doctor Consultation Module:** Redirects users to online doctor consultation platforms.

## Technologies Used
### **Programming & Frameworks**
- **Python** (Flask, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **HTML/CSS, Bootstrap** (for frontend UI)
- **Flask-SQLAlchemy** (Database Management)
- **Joblib & Pickle** (Model Serialization)
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (Data Visualization)

### **Machine Learning Models**
- **Decision Tree Classifier**
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Na誰ve Bayes Classifier**
- **Support Vector Classifier (SVC)**

How It Works
User Registration/Login: Users create an account or log in.
Input Medical Parameters: Enter details such as age, cholesterol, BP, etc.
Model Prediction: The system runs inputs through ML models to generate results.
Results Page: Displays prediction result (Heart Disease: Yes/No).
Consultation Module: Redirects users to online doctor consultation if needed.

Dataset Description
The dataset (heart.csv) consists of 14 attributes related to heart health:
Age
Sex
Chest Pain Type (cp)
Resting Blood Pressure (trestbps)
Serum Cholesterol (chol)
Fasting Blood Sugar (fbs)
Resting ECG (restecg)
Max Heart Rate Achieved (thalach)
Exercise Induced Angina (exang)
ST Depression (oldpeak)
Slope of Peak Exercise ST Segment (slope)
Number of Major Vessels (ca)
Thalassemia (thal)
Target (1: Disease, 0: No Disease)

Machine Learning Model Performance
The models have been trained on the dataset to predict heart disease:
Model	Accuracy
Decision Tree	~85%
Logistic Regression	~87%
Na誰ve Bayes	~84%
SVC	~86%
Future Enhancements
Implement Deep Learning (Neural Networks) for better accuracy.
Deploy on Cloud for real-world accessibility.
Mobile Application for easier usability.
Smart wearable device integration for real-time monitoring.
